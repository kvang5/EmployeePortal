### Problem Statement
Golden Sun Home Care is a Home Healthcare business that was establish in the year of 2017. Golden Sun Home Care is licenses with the State of North Carolina to cater to the elderly and individuals that are need of assistance. The clients are either Medicaid patients, private hired, or assigned by the state. With these clients, Golden Sun Home Care hired Register Nurses, Certified Nursing Assistants, and caregivers to assist the clients with plans to help the clients get better with illness, injuries or assistant around the house. 

Golden Sun Home Care is a new business with business operations that are in need some assistant to keep them going. Golden Sun Home Care keeps track of time entry from employees care services, employee time sheet, care description for clients, and administrator duties to keep track of employees and client services. The problem with these situations is that Golden Sun Home Care is new to the business and has been keeping all their documentations through paper. As a business major and previous Manager at a restaurant, having to keep all the documentations via paper can be costly and could potentially cost the business lots of revenue loss.

The solution to help Golden Sun Home Care is to set a Web Application employee portal that will enable all employees, like Agency Director to RNs to CNAs to caregivers, the ability to log in submit their time sheet, description of care and other concerns for clients to Golden Sun Home Care without having to fill paper work for care services. This will allow the business to grow and control revenues generated from clients and the state with services Golden Sun Home Care provide.
